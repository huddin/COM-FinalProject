      <h1>Project Approach</h1>
      <h2>Rationale for the Topic and Approach</h2>
      <p>
        One of the major issues with the current yard waste system in Chicago is communication and lack of knowledge.
        There is an extreme lack of communication to the residents of Chicago who don’t all understand the need to
        reduce yard waste. Many don’t even make use of or even know that programs exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem also lies in the Streets and Sanitation Department and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
        (IEPA). Many of the offices do not recommend calling 311 and instead recommend leaving yard waste in black
        trash bags next to the rest of your garbage. The IEPA doesn’t even have guidelines on how to collect landscape
        waste.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our main objective is to reduce yard waste and make sure that it is properly recycled. In response to the lack
        of knowledge in the people, and the lack of action in the government, we propose an app called ------
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to Toronto’s TOwaste App, this app will feature maps of drop off locations, waste collection schedules,
        and ways to search for how to properly dispose or recycle particular types of yard waste. For example, instead
        of getting rid of your waste, you can learn how to make it into mulch for yourself. This way we can educate the
        residents of Chicago on proper yard waste disposal and recycling.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key feature that is unique to our app is the ability to request certain types of waste so that other people
        nearby can drop theirs off to you or you can choose to pick up. On one hand people can offer waste that they
        want to get rid of. While on the other hand, people who can make use of waste can get it for free by requesting
        it from people nearby. This will help in greatly reducing the amount of yard waste that still needs to be
        picked up by 311 calls.

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        The app is intended to give the people of Chicago the tools to deal with their own yard waste. It will provide
        them information on where they can drop off yard waste, what qualifies as yard waste, how they can recycle and
        reuse various kinds of yard waste, and give easy access to information on existing programs and collection
        schedules. In no way are we changing or reforming any existing programs. It does not fix issues with the
        Streets and Sanitation Department, or the IEPA.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app does not extend as well to those outside of Chicago. They will not be able to make use of finding
        nearby people or places to drop off their yard waste, or look at relevant collection schedules. However, they
        can still utilize the other information provided by the app.
