      <h1>Chicago Waste</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The objective of this report is to find a better solution to reducing yard waste in Chicago. Residents of
        Chicago aren’t properly informed and the current 311 system fails to accomplish what it was designed to do. We
        propose to create an app that educates the people of Chicago on how to reuse and responsibly dispose of their
        yard waste. The app also allows them to collaborate amongst each other and give unneeded yard waste to those
        nearby who want it.

      <h2>Information</h2>
      <p>
        When yard waste isn’t properly reused, it takes up space in landfills that could be used for non-recyclable
        items. In addition, it can decompose and produce methane in anaerobic conditions such as in trash bags. This is
        an even greater contributor to climate change than carbon dioxide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yard waste comes in many forms: like grass clippings, branches, dry leaves, and more. The thing is, if these
        things aren’t contaminated, that is they aren’t mixed with other waste, they can be recycled. Yard waste can be
        manufactured into soil, compost, and mulch that is very effective for plants and landscapes while reducing the
        need for chemicals or pesticides.
      </p>
      <p>
        There exist various programs to handle yard waste in each city, and currently Chicago residents can call 311 to
        request separate yard waste collection. The lack of success has increased the need for a new solution to yard
        waste collection and recycling.
