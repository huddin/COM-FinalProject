      <h1>City Comparison</h1>
      <p>
        The first city that we compared to Chicago’s yard waste disposal methods was Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Although
        smaller in size, Milwaukee shares the same climate as Chicago and they face the same issues of heavy leaf
        collection in the Autumn months. Unlike Chicago, the citizens of Milwaukee do not have to call the city in
        order to dispose of their yard waste. According to the City of Milwaukee website they have designated pickups
        throughout the fall months in order to assist their residents with disposing their yard waste. Through the
        dates of October 1 to November 15 residents of Milwaukee have the option to rake leaves onto the street for
        sanitation services to collect. They explicitly state on their website to not put leaves into bags, keep the
        piles one foot away from the curbs, place yard debris (Flowers, plants, ect.) on top of leaf piles and to not
        include pumpkins, plastic bags, or any other items

      <p>
        The City of Milwaukee takes the leaves to a waste management compost site where they turn the leaves into
        compost and then sell it locally. If an individual still has leaves past the November 15 date they still offer
        roadside leaf collection but a request must be made by calling the number 414-286-CITY (2489). These leaf
        collection requests must be received by November 30th. For all other yard waste and leaves outside of the
        roadside leaf collection service the residents of Milwaukee are encouraged to compost their yard waste or to
        leave clippings/mulched leaves on their lawn to decompose and nourish the soil. The residents are also
        encouraged to Take their yard waste to a drop off center where it will be processed. Currently there are two
        drop off centers in Milwaukee and the website details Accepted and Prohibited Items. Overall, the City of
        Milwaukee has very clear instructions as to what options residents have with their yard waste. All of this
        information can be found on their website.

        The next city we compared to Chicago was Boston, Massachusetts. According to the City of Boston website, the
        city picks up yard waste from residents though the months of April to December. The waste is collected curbside
        every other week and there are guidelines one must follow listed on their website. The yard waste must be in
        large paper bags or open barrels labels “Yard Waste” and they do not accept the use of plastic bags. The yard
        waste must be curbside by 7 A.M. on collection days and Christmas Trees ar picked up during the first two weeks
        of January. They also collect branches which must be tied with string, maximum size being three feet long with
        one inch of diameter placed alongside other yard waste.The schedule for yard waste pickup is also listen on the
        website. Boston also provides its residents with a “Trash Day App” that allows people to see when their
        collection days are, set reminders, and provides a directory of common household items to inform users of
        proper disposal methods. The information listed on their website pertaining to yard waste disposal is very
        sparse and reminds me of Chicago's. They provide the minimum necessary information and they do not provide
        users with an “Items permitted/Items prohibited” section.

        The international city we compared Chicago to was Toronto Canada. Toronto has an extremely similar population
        as Chicago and shares nearly identical climates with our City. Information on the City of Toronto website shows
        the City picks up yard waste every other week on garbage collection day from the months of March to December.
        This drastically differs from Chicago in the sense that it is expected for residents to set out their yard
        waste next to their garbage bins instead of calling a 311 number in order to dispose of their unwanted
        material. Toronto also has very clear cut instructions as to how to dispose of this waste as well. The City
        website states that residents must place yard waste in a Kraft paper yard waste bad or an open topped
        container(55cm-95cm Tall) and does not accept cardboard boxes or plastic bags. Brush and bushes must be bundles
        together and cannot exceed four feet in length, two feet in width, and cannot weigh more than 44 pounds. They
        also dispose of wood but the size is extremely small; diameter cannot exceed three inches. In terms of material
        that is accepted as yard waste we have; Leaves, weeds and brush, mulch, pumpkins, corn stalks, and Christmas
        trees(Only in the month of January). Material not accepted includes; Grass clippings(Encouraged to leave on
        lawn to build healthy soil), Sod, and Soil. This yard waste is turned into compost and then sold, some of it is
        offered to the public on Community Environment Days for free. As mentioned before Toronto also has an
        interactive waste application available to Android and iOS. This application allows residents to lookup items
        they want to dispose of (Knowledge base of over 2000 items) and tells them which bins to put the item into.
        Informs residents of collection schedules, has a map of Drop off locations(Toronto currently has 7) and has a
        map of locations where you can buy or donate used items.
